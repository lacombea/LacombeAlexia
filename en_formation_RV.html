									<h2>Abstract</h2>
								</header>
								<p style="margin: 0 0 0.5em 0;">
									The objective of this internship was the implementation of a virtual reality and/or augmented reality environment allowing the implementation of traceability and hygiene protocols for training.<br>
									I thus worked around 3 parts :
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The modeling of a virtual reality environment on Unity, especially on the animation part of the objects but also the interaction between the objects and the participant.</li>
									<li>The development and implementation of a scenario for this training focused on the procedure of cooking, rapid cooling and storage of a food using Mascaret, a system developed by the CERV.</li>
									<li>The integration of the software developed by the company e-ManRisk within the 3D environment and the possibility of interacting with it using the node library: Puppeteer.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>For this project, I used an oculus quest.</p>

									<h2>Preliminary design phase</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									A first part of the project was to study the expectations and discuss with the company's business team. 
									The traceability and hygiene protocol that would be implemented for this training had been chosen beforehand. 
									It is a procedure of cooking, fast cooling and storage of a food that is done in the laboratory of the stores.
									<br>
									<br>
									It was therefore necessary to decide with the business team what <b>type of training</b> was going to be done, as this affects the assistance given to the learner and his or her freedom to act in the 3D environment.
									<br>
									The final choice was to carry out an <b>initial training</b> : the objects to be used will be highlighted and the procedure will be broken down into many simple actions so that the learner can assimilate in a more effective way the procedures to which one wishes to train him.

								<p>
									<br>
									Afterwards, I studied different solutions for the implementation of training in Virtual Reality.
									Having the opportunity for this project to work in collaboration with the <b>CERV</b> (European Center for Virtual Reality) at Brest, I was able to use the system they develop : <b>Mascaret</b>. 
									It is a system allowing to link UML diagrams (in particular class and activity diagrams) and a virtual reality environment modeled on a 3D game engine such as Unity, in order to realize training.

									<h2>Time management</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									The procedure that the learner is brought to realize during this training can be rather long, there is the time of cooking but also the time of cooling which can last until <b>two hours</b>.
									In the real world, an operator would have to perform other procedures or perform it with other foods while the food is cooking or cooling, in the case of training there is no point in overloading the learner with other foods or multiple procedures, so a way had to be found to make the time flow within the virtual environment without the cooking or cooling seeming immediate. 
									Two solutions to <b>spatialize the environment in time</b> have been implemented: the use of clocks and the use of fade screens.
								</p>
								<h3>Clocks</h3>
								<p>
									A clock has been placed in the laboratory to indicate the time to the learner. 
									Throughout the course, <b> time passes at a normal pace</b> and is displayed on the clock. 
									A second clock is placed above the handwashing station to indicate the time required for the learner to wash his or her hands and to enforce the fact that this step must take more than 30 seconds.

										</p>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Fade screens</h3>
								<p>
									The use of fade screen to make time pass is a very common process in games and cartoons. I decided to use it when an action lasts for too long, for example when the learner puts the chicken in the oven and it has to cook, a fade screen with the time passing is displayed for a few seconds. 
									This time also runs on the main clock so that it remains <b>coherent</b>.

									<h2>Management of food contamination</h2>
								</header>
								
								<p>
									As this training is mainly concerned with food hygiene and the aim of this procedure is to find out if a food has been potentially contaminated by bacteria, it is important that food contamination is at the heart of our virtual reality, so we will make it visible so that the learner can better perceive it and confront him with the case where the food is contaminated or not.
								</p>
								<h3>
									Visualization of bacteria
								</h3>
								<p>
									In order for the learner to better understand the dangers of bacteria, a different aspect will be applied to the food when it is contaminated and to the hands when they are dirty.
									This visualization makes food contamination more explicit and is more fun and memorable than simply saying that the hands are dirty or the food is contaminated.
								</p>
								<ul class="features">
									<li>
										<div class = "frame">
											<img class = "imgFrame" src="images/eManRisk/contamine.png" style="cursor:pointer" onclick="onClick(this)"></img>
										</div>
										<p class = "legende">
											Uncontaminated/contaminated food
										</p>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>
									The impact of bacteria in training
								</h3>
								<p>
									In reality, operators do not know if a food is contaminated or not until they reach the end of the rapid cooling procedure, so the choice was made to do the same in this training: a random value is assigned to the food at the start of the simulation in order to determine if it is contaminated or not.
									The learner performs temperature measurements of the food when the cooling procedure is complete that will determine whether or not the food should be stored. <br><Br>
										However, food contamination is also caused by a bad respect of procedures, the learner starts his training with dirty hands as it would be the case in real life, so if he touches a food before having properly washed his hands or if a food touches the ground it will become contaminated, a few seconds later a screen telling the participant that the food is contaminated and that he must start again will be displayed.

									<h2>Implementation of the e-ManRisk software in the virtual environment</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									The software developed by e-ManRisk makes it possible to record the results of quality controls performed in laboratories. 
									The software is used on <b>tablets</b> because that is what is most practical in this context. 
									An important element of this project was to be able to do the same in virtual reality : to have a tablet that would allow to take in hand the software and to record the control realized during the training.<br>
									Unity does not offer a web browser that can be integrated into the 3D environment, there is no free tool that allows this and creating this type of tool would have been too much work, we had to find another solution to have access to the e-ManRisk application. 
									The solution will be to use the Puppeteer library.
								</p>
								<h3>The Puppeteer library</h3>
								<p>
									The Puppeteer library allows you to interact with a Chrome web browser, via a Node server, as you would on a computer, but in an automated way.
									You can simulate mouse clicks or keyboard presses, but also extract pdf files or take screenshots of pages.<br>
									This is how the e-ManRisk web application will be navigated: a screenshot of the current page will be taken and displayed on the table in the virtual environment, the user should be able to click on the site and the displayed page should change or elements should appear. 
									We also want the text fields to be fillable, so we need to be able to model a <b>keyboard</b> for the tablet.
								</p>
								<h3>The tablet in the 3D environment</h3>
								<p>
									For the sake of precision in interacting with the tablet, there will in fact be two tablets in the virtual world: a first one will be placed in the laboratory at <b>real size</b> that the user will have to grasp in order to be transferred in front of a larger tablet with which he will be able to <b>interact with a pointer</b> and on which a keyboard will be displayed if necessary.
